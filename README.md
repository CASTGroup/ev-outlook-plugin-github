We have added some feature to the original version:
* Default Folder: in every client you can specify a default save folder
* Last used Folder: you can save in the last used folder
* Settings. It's now possible to specify different icons and images. It's also possibile to specify which save option the user can see.

Microsoft Outlook Plugin for Alfresco 5.2 from EisenVault. This allows one-way communication - i.e. saving of emails and attachments from Outlook to Alfresco. It has been tested with Outlook 2010, 2013 and 2016 on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10. 
It is compatible with Alfresco Community 5.2 as it uses the 5.2 REST APIs. It doesn't work with older versions of Alfresco.

You can either download installer binaries, or download the source code and compile with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. Code is in C#.
